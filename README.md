# Teaching-Materials
This repository contains progressive, technology-integrated teaching materials developed for Electrical Machines and Power Electronics area courses in Middle East Technical University (METU). The materials include:
* Homeworks solved using computational tools (such as MATLAB)
* Laboratory experiment updates and new experiments
* Course projects which require simulation environments or experimental verification

The cources are:
1. EE361 - Electromechanical Energy Conversion I
2. EE362 - Electromechanical Energy Conversion II
3. EE462 - Electric Motor Drives
